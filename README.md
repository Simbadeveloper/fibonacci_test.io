what am learning about fibonacci.....<br >

#
Each new number in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two Fibonacci numbers. For example by starting with the numbers 1 and 2 being the first and second numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence looks like this:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 <br >

<hr>
general formular:<br >

fibonacci(n) = Fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)<br >
<hr>

# Recursive
for a recursive function to stop calling itself we require some type of stopping condition.<br >
the recursion stop when it reach the base (end), every recurse function must have a base condition that stops the recursion or else the function calls itself inifinity.We must avoid infite recursion.<br >
If it is not the base case then we simplify our computation using the general formula<br >

stopping condition<br >
fibonacci(0) = 1<br >
fibonacci(1) = 1<br >

# Rules for writing recursive functions
1. know when to stop (the base)<br >
2. Decide how to take one step towards the base case<br >
3. Phrase the function in terms of one step and a smaller version of the original problem<br >

for numbers,  the base is usually a small interger  constant and a smaller version of the problem is something like n-1.<br >

# Recursive and factoral
To understand fibobacci you have to know about recursive and factoral.<br >
Recursive is a function which either calls itself or is in  a potential cycle of function calls.
 <hr>
Factorial of a  number is the product of all the interger from  to that number.<br >
for example the factorila of 6 (denoted 6!) is 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720<br >
<hr>
formula
n! = n* (n-1)! <br >

0! = 1<br >
consider the examples<br >
1! =  1 * 0! = 1 * 1 = 1<br >
2! = 2 * 1!= 2 * 1 = 2<br >
3! = 3 * 2! = 3 * 2 = 6<br >

<hr >
def F(n):<br >
    if n == 0: return 0<br >
    elif n == 1: return 1<br >
    else: return F(n-1)+F(n-2)<br >
 
#
    
    def F():
    a,b = 0,1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b
